While there I decided to research the possibility of Long Short Term Memory networks to identify a person with and without makeup (a task that traditional face detection algorithms sometimes struggle with). As part of my research, I trained an algorithm on a database of Instagram photos. It yielded a result with 97% accuracy, so I analyzed it and wrote a paper about it.<br><br>resources: <a href='Facial_Recogdnition_With_Makeup.pdf'>abstract.pdf</a>"],
